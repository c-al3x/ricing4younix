# ricing4younix

ricing4younix is my ricing 4 unix that can be ricing 4 you!

Feel free to use my configuration files here for your ricing needs or to learn from them. I have most definitely learned by studying others' config files.

So far, I have done ricing for macOS and GNU/Linux distributions, though only Manjaro so far. (I am going to begin ricing for Gentoo soon.)

As mentioned in the name, this is for ricing UNIX-like operating system installs. If you are not using a UNIX-like operating system (such as Microsoft Windows), then you might have to either place these configuration files in different directories, can't use at all because the corresponding program is not executable on your operating system, etc., but feel free to still try to use them! I am planning on eventually ricing a Windows install.

Note (to myself): Configuration files for calcurse and newsboat are not uploaded. Also, Ubersicht widget, powerbar, for macOS rice is incorrectly named powerbar2.
